		<h1>Challenge 3 /// The Static Web</h1>
		<h3>
		<p>
			Create a web page that has a navigation bar and plenty of articles so that the content goes well below the fold (fancy term for the amount of real estate that exists when the user first loads the page).</p>

		<p>
			When the user scrolls now to read the rest of the content, the navigation bar should remain at the top of the page, always visible, no matter how far down the user scrolls.</h3>
